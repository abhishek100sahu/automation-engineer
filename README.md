- Python (**or Bash/PowerShell for system automation**)
- Learn:
  - Variables, loops, functions, file handling
  - Logging & debugging (Loguru for Python)
  - Working with APIs (Requests module)

✅ **Step 2: Version Control with Git (10-15 hrs)**
- Git basics (clone, commit, push, pull, branching)
- Work with GitHub/GitLab

✅ **Step 3: Learn CI/CD Basics (15-20 hrs)**
- **Jenkins/GitHub Actions/GitLab CI/CD**
- Create a pipeline for a simple script or app.

---

## **🚀 Phase 2: Test Automation & Frameworks (Weeks 5-8)**
### 🎯 Goal: Learn test automation (Web, API, Performance)  
✅ **Step 4: UI & Web Automation (40-50 hrs)**
- Selenium WebDriver (Python or Java)
- Locators (XPath, CSS), handling alerts, frames, waits
- Build a test framework (Pytest + Selenium)

✅ **Step 5: API Testing & Automation (20-30 hrs)**
- **Postman/Newman**
- **Requests library (Python)**
- Automate API tests with **Pytest**

✅ **Step 6: Performance Testing (15-20 hrs)**
- JMeter or k6 for performance/load testing

---

## **⚡ Phase 3: DevOps & Infrastructure Automation (Weeks 9-12)**
### 🎯 Goal: Learn Infrastructure as Code (IaC) & Cloud Basics  
✅ **Step 7: Learn Docker & Kubernetes (40-50 hrs)**
- **Docker** (Container basics, images, networking)
- **Kubernetes** (Basic pod deployments)

✅ **Step 8: Configuration Management (20-30 hrs)**
- **Ansible** (For automating configurations)
- Write simple playbooks

✅ **Step 9: AWS Fundamentals (30-40 hrs)**
- AWS EC2, S3, Lambda, CloudWatch
- AWS IoT Core (For IoT automation, if relevant)

---

## **🔥 Phase 4: Advanced Topics & Specialization (Weeks 13-20)**
### 🎯 Goal: Deep dive into specific domains (IoT, Security, AI for testing)  

✅ **Step 10: Advanced CI/CD (20-30 hrs)**
- Deploy automation scripts using CI/CD
- Build a pipeline that integrates testing

✅ **Step 11: Security & Compliance Automation (20-30 hrs)**
- OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite for security testing

✅ **Step 12: Infrastructure & Cloud Automation (40-50 hrs)**
- Terraform (for AWS infrastructure automation)

✅ **Step 13: IoT & Edge Automation (Optional, 40 hrs)**
- MQTT, Node-RED, AWS IoT Core

---

## **🔄 Continuous Learning & Practice (Weeks 21+)**
- Work on **real-world automation projects**
- Contribute to **open-source automation frameworks**
- Learn **new frameworks & tools (Playwright, Cypress, etc.)**
- Stay updated with **DevOps trends**

---

### **⏳ Time Breakdown (≈400-500 hrs)**
| Topic | Time (Hours) |
|--------|-------------|
| Scripting (Python, Bash) | 40 |
| Version Control (Git) | 15 |
| CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions) | 35 |
| Test Automation (Selenium, API, JMeter) | 90 |
